    "## R Statistical Analysis Software\n",
    "\n",
    "R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. R allows you to store, trans-form and analyse data and produce charts and tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one main difference between R and programs like Excel or other spreadsheet packages and that is that it doesn't use menus or a what we call a \"Graphical User Interface\" (or GUI). If you think back to fundamental methods, all of the practicals you did were in Excel where you would click through a series of menus to complete the task. This is fine for analyses that are simple with only a few steps, but when we get to more advanced and complex analyses with multiple steps we need a different approach. This is where R comes in. Unlike with Excel, our interaction with R is through programming or coding where we write a series of commands that are sent to the R software for execution. So, instead of a series of menus that we click on, with R we have to write out our commands and save them in what are called \"scripts\". These scripts are just documents with collections of R programming commands. This has a huge advantage when we come to do our analysis because these scripts essentially contain an entire record of the various steps that you take. This is really useful if we want to change anything in our analysis or if we make a mistake early on because rather than having to re-click all of those menus, with a script, we can just go back to the part we want to change and then re-run the script to reproduce our analysis. This is the basis for modern statistical analysis in academic research; writing analysis scripts that are reproducible and efficient. These programming skills are widely used in many professional careers and are hugely sought after by many employers! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the practicals over the next few weeks we are going to introduce you to the basics of programming in R. We will help you work through using a variety of statistical tests and methods in and how to write ocmmands to carry them out using the R software. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will be using what are known as \"Jupyter notebooks\" such as this one. Jupyter notebooks are great learning tools because they are essentially a combination of textbooks and software. They allow you to write and execute code \"live\" alongside text/images that explain what is going on (rather than for example a separate word document with instructions). Each week, you will have a new notebook and a new dataset to work with Demonstrators will be available to help in each online practical session. If you require assistance at any time, just alert the demonstrators who will assist you as soon as they can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following exercises are intended to help you in learning how to use R and will inevitably seem like you are just following instructions. It would be easy to do this without thinking – if you push the right buttons you will get the “right” answers. However, for your formative and summative assessments, you will not receive such close guidance – these practicals are to prepare you for this! The exercises in this practical will involve you typing out (or copying and pasting if you prefer!) commands as directed into empty code cells and executing these commands. As you do this, try to think about what is going on behind the scenes at all times. What are the results telling you? Are they significant? Why did you run a particular test? What does the test mean? Is it the correct test? Thinking about it like this will help you enormously on the assessment, and if you choose to include any kind of quantitative analysis in your dissertation. There are many manuals and textbooks that can provide guidance on statistics, but they cannot tell you what to do when you are working with your own data; you will have to decide which tests to use with what data and how to interpret the results. This is what we will be testing in the assessment. Throughout the practical there will also be exercises where you will have to think about the code you need. This should help you develop these skills on your own. The answers to these exercises can be found at the end of the notebook if you get really stuck but do try on your own first or ask a demonstrator for help as this will help you learn much more effectively. Feel free to work in groups if this is helpful as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look in the noteable files area, in the folder where you found this notebook, you should see a file called \"FloridaSalaries.csv\". This is the datafile we are going to be working with for this practical. It consists of a data file containing data on starting salaries for graduates from the University of Florida. Each row of data in the file contains information about an individual graduate including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sex\n",
    "* The college they graduated from\n",
    "* Salary\n",
    "* Type of degree\n",
    "* Date of graduation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages\n",
    "Before we get started, the first thing we need to do is import some packages to our R session. These packages are part of the built-in functionality in python. What are packages? R works through the use of a whole bunch of \"add-on\" packages which can be thought of as different pieces of software. Because of this, we need to actually import these packages each time we start a new R session. R has loads of these \"built-in\" packages. To import these packages we use the command `library()` and put the name of the package we need in the brackets. \n",

This code may look complicated but if you look at it carefully it is very similar to the code we worked through above. This time though we include the list of labels we want to add. Notice how the label we want to add comes first, followed by `=` and then the value the label applies to. Also note the use of `\"` when specifying the labels. This just tells R that we are working with text information. Run the code in the cell below and then examine the data in the usual way to see that it has added the labels. You should be able to see that the `graddate` variable now includes informative labels."
