    "Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this introductory practical exercise we are going to introduce ourselves to the very basics of computer programming, skills which are essential in modern data analysis. We will also introduce ourselves to the noteable and jupyter notebook platform that we will be using for the pracrical sessions.\n",

    "What is a Jupyter Notebook?!\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to get familiarised with what a jupyter notebook actually is! First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running computer programming code. The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of languages. However, each notebook is associated with a single language whcih runs in a kernel. What is a kernel I hear you ask? Think of the kernel basically as the \"computer\", the thing that is going to \"interpret\" the commands you send to it. This notebook is associated with the R statistical analysis software, therefore it interprets and runs R commands and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of these notebooks is that they contain both interactive elements (where you run code and see the results) and traditional textbook or instructions material in one place (no more switching between a word document with instructions and the actual software!). They are primarily organised around \"cells\". A cell can be a \"Markdown\" type of cell which contains text or instructions (like this one). Or it can be a \"code\" cell which contains the raw computer code. When you \"run\" or \"execute\" a code cell the commands in the cell are sent to the computer to be interpreted and then run. The computer then sends back the result which will be displayed as output below the cell. Lets try out running some code with a classic first example...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello World!\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "When programmers first start learning to code (as you are!) including learning a new language, we tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message \"Hello world!\". This has become a bit of a tradition among programmers and developers! It is a simple program that shows whether your computer is properly set up to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets do that. Copy and paste the code below into the the cell below. Then run the code by using either `Shift-Enter` or pressing the \"run\"  button in the toolbar above:\n",
    "\n",

Run the below code to see this (it will take 5 seconds to complete):\n",

This will allow you to save a copy of the notebook with a new filename so that if you ever want to return to the original notebook you can. <b>When you do this, a box will pop up with `Archives-Data-Science-Workshop/` written in it. Delete all of this text and just write whatever you want to call your notebook in the box and click `save`.</b>\n",
